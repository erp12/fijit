# Fijit

Clojure is a great language, but some people use Scala... and that's okay!

Fijit is a Clojure library for interop with Scala. The goal of this project is to make it easier and more idiomatic to 
use Scala projects from within your Clojure projects. Some key features include:

- Conversions between Scala and Clojure collection types.
- Macros for writing Clojure code that targets multiple Scala versions.
- A Clojure implementation of the Scala function types.
- Idiomatic Clojure wrappers for common Scala types like `Option`, `Try`, `Tuple`, and more.
- An experimental Clojure API for Scala reflection and compilation.
