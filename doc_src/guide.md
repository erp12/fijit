# Guide to Fijit

Clojure is a great language, but some people use Scala... and that's okay!

## Rationale

Should you create a hybrid Clojure and Scala project? NO!

What if you are forced to call out to a Scala project? Plain old JVM interop usually works.

Fijit makes this easier by providing an idiomatic Clojure API into Scala constructs that commonly appear in 
Scala interfaces.
